# Chitter API

A knock-off of Twitter! This front-end program interacts with an API backend which provides posts, users and likes.

## How to use ##
- Clone this repository `git clone git@github.com:JL-J/chitter-api.git`
- Run `npm install`
- To start the server run `http-server` from the command line.
- Visit http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser.

## Using Chitter ##
A user must first either sign in or sign up to the service. Once logged in the 50 most recent peeps will be displayed.

## Technologies used ##
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- CSS grids 

## Further development ##
- Users can create peeps: I want to show and hide the second row in the grid so that it either lets you sign up/in, or once logged in allows you to create a peep.
- Create a sign out button which also destroys cookies?
